# 🛍️ Capstone 3: EasyShop E-Commerce API & Web Application

Welcome to EasyShop, a full-stack e-commerce application project designed for users to browse, search, and purchase products online. This application simulates a real-world online shopping experience and includes both backend API development (using Spring Boot and MySQL) and a frontend user interface (HTML/CSS).


## 🌐 Project Overview

Currently, the application supports:

- 🔍 Product browsing and searching
- 🗂️ Viewing product details
- 📁 Browsing products by category

This project was built to demonstrate CRUD operations, API consumption using Postman and AJAX, database integration, and frontend rendering with HTML templates.

⚠️ Note: Some features such as the shopping cart and checkout are under development and not fully functional. The ShoppingCart and ShoppingCartItem models are in place, but viewing and adding to cart currently fails due to unresolved backend issues.


🧭 Future Features (Planned)
Priority	Feature
- 🔒 High	Shopping cart + checkout
- 🔐 High	User login and authentication
- 💾 Medium	Order history for users

- 💳 Low	Payment gateway integration (e.g. Stripe)
- 📱 Low	Mobile-friendly/responsive design
